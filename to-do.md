To-do:
homepage/base
make nav bar highlight the page we are currently on (blue line)
move google login button up higher
make the blue button (that says your name when logged in) be in a sensible place
maybe remove "login with google" on top right after logged in?
add small description to homepage to tell user why they should use our site/ what it does

all-refills
make cards with refills look nicer and be in reasonable location
place blue shape in top right corner

new-med
make look pretty
hint: the template has built-in css classes that will make it look better
make the last two lines on the same line (so it says "repeat every 2 weeks" if you select 2 and weeks)
place blue shape in top right corner
