# Pharm_Assist #
**Description:** Pharm Assist integrates with your Google Calendar, adding prescription reminders through a simple input form. See the full list of your prescriptions on the homepage, easily add reminders, and choose how far in advance you'd like to get a reminder. Choose to use nicknames so that you don't have to broadcast your prescriptions on your calendar.
